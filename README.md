**Data and viz of interest**

1. Find a journal or newspaper article that relates data science to a humanities topic that you are interested in.
  * Post a link to the article in the next cell and comment on why it interests you.
2. Find a data visualization that you would love to know how to make with Python
  * Include the image in the next cell too and comment on why you like it.

1. [National Endowment for the Arts Announces First Round of Fiscal Year 2023 Grants](file:///Users/evelynchoi/Desktop/1*F9gf07Uzo9RyLdg52yDeNQ.png)
 I find this topic to be very interesting because I did a digital humanities project that focused on Arts and Culture grants and how those grants are distributed.

I am interested to learn how to build this type of data visualization because I made a data visual very similar to this one and found that it was really good at representing the data and doesn't feel too convoluted.

<b>Ideas for data to investigate</b>

    1. Getting Data: Web Scraping and APIs
        1. I have always wanted to learn more about how data is collected and how it could be collected more efficiently. I am also interested in learning about APIs because I have always heard about it but was never familiar with what it was.

<b>Ideas from curated datasets & project lists</b>

Review the projects and datasets on the following two pages:
* https://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w21/final-project/datasets
* https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php

Make a table in the cell below that includes columns for (1) the name of any dataset of interest, (2) a brief description of the data and how you might investigate it in a project, and (3) a link to the data.
    
There is no restriction on number of datasets to include, but please include at least two.
