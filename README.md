**Data and viz of interest**
    
   The primary focus for my project is to analyze the tone and sentiment of the characters from Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice, pulled from Project Gutenberg. I want to do this research on this subject because I want to learn more about how much tone, word choice, and sentiment affect the story itself and the characters within it. Jane Austen has a very distinctive style of writing that makes her stand out compared to other authors within the same genre, and I'm curious to know how her style differs, whether it be word frequency or linguistic style.
    
Questions:
    
- How does Elizabeth Bennet's and Mr. Darcy's relationship develop as the story progresses? 
- Why do different genders in Pride and Prejudice speak differently, and how does this effect the novel's overall tone and message? 
- What significant events cause shifts in how people feel in Pride and Prejudice, and what causes those shifts to occur? 
- How do the sentiments of Pride and Prejudice's various social classes vary? 
- How can certain words or word categories help to develop the ideas of Pride and Prejudice? 
- How does Pride and Prejudice's evolving main characters and their relationship with one another shape the novel's tone? 
- What are some similarities and differences in the language and emotion used by the various characters in Pride and Prejudice, and how do these elements develop over the novel?
